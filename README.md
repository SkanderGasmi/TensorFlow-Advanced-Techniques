# TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques

Welcome to the TensorFlow: Advanced Techniques portfolio! This repository is a central hub for a comprehensive collection of advanced TensorFlow projects.

Feel free to exploree each sub-repository for advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques with TensorFlow:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. [Custom Models Layers and Loss Functions with TensorFlow](https://github.com/SkanderGasmi/Custom-Models-Layers-and-Loss-Functions-with-TensorFlow):

In this repository we compare Functional and Sequential APIs, build custom loss functions, and create custom layers for our models.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. [Custom and Distributed Training with TensorFlow](https://github.com/SkanderGasmi/Custom-and-Distributed-Training-with-TensorFlow):
In this repository we manipulate Tensor objects, build custom training loops using GradientTape, and harness the power of distributed training which is a key component in the era of big data and AI.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. [Advanced Computer Vision with TensorFlow](https://github.com/SkanderGasmi/Advanced-Computer-Vision-with-TensorFlow)
In this repository, we explore some advanced computer vision topics, like object detection, image segmentation, object localization etc. We also apply transfer learning and customize object detection models and finally interpret model predictions using class activation maps and saliency maps

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. [Generative Deep Learning with TensorFlow](https://github.com/SkanderGasmi/Generative-Deep-Learning-with-TensorFlow)
In this repository, we dive into generative deep learning techniques, like neural style transfer and AutoEncoders, Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
